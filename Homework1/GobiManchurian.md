## Gobi Manchurian
<!---
Name: Vaishnavi Dornadula
-->

One of the best rainy day snacks is an Indo-Chinese street food called Gobi Manchurian. This crispy cauliflower treat is usually made deep fried to get that extra crunch but is just as tasty in the healtier pan fried version. This recipe will be based on https://hebbarskitchen.com/dry-gobi-manchurian-recipe/.

The process is a bit repetative and tedious but that first bite makes it all worth it. As usual with Indian cooking, the measurements are not exact and are slightly up to the chef's taste.

Now let's not delay any longer and jump into cooking!

### Ingredients for Battered Gobi (Cauliflower)
- 1 cauliflower (or equivalent amount of cauliflower florets)
- 1.5 cups all purpose flour
- 1 cup corn starch
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp pepper
- 1 tsp red chilli powder
- 1/2 cup oil
- water, for consistency

### Ingredients for Manchurian Sauce
- 1 cup soy sauce
- 3/4 cup ketchup
- 3/8 cup siracha
- 4 tsp oil
- 2 cloves garlic, finely choppind
- 1/2 inch ginger, finely chopped
- 1 green chilli, finely chopped
- 1/2 onion, finely chopped
- 1/2 capsicum (bell pepper), cubed
- green onions (for garnish)

### Instructions
1. Mix the all purpose flour, corn starch, salt, pepper, and red chilli powder in a large bowl.
2. Once those dry ingredients are well mixed, start adding water bit by bit until the batter is a sludgy texture.
3. If not already in florets, cut the cauliflower into heads
4. Fold the florets into the batter and ensure that each piece is well coated.
5. With a sauce pan on medium heat pour in oil to make a small layer on the bottom.
6. Once the oil is hot enough, start adding the coated cauliflower florets to pan fry
7. Place them on a surface covered with a tissue to soak up any excess oil.
8. Mix the soy sauce, siracha, and ketchup in a bowl and adjust to taste
9. Roast the garlic, ginger, onion, chili, and capsicum in a pan
10. Add in the pan fried cauliflower bits to the vegetable mixture
11. Add in 3/4 of the sauce mixture and mix well
12. Once the sauce has coated each piece well and become more crunchy, add the rest of the sauce as a gravy
13. Turn off the heat and add the chopped green onion pieces as a garnish if desired
