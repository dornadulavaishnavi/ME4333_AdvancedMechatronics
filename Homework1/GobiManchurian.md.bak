## Gobi Manchurian

Name: Vaishnavi Dornadula

One of the best rainy day snacks is an Indo-Chinese street food called Gobi Manchurian. This crispy cauliflower treat is usually made deep fried to get that extra crunch but is just as tasty in the healtier pan fried version. This recipe will be based on https://hebbarskitchen.com/dry-gobi-manchurian-recipe/.
